# Chatroom

> Version 1.0

The `React` + `Typescript` + `Yarn` + `Vite` + `Firebase` + `Material UI` project!

## Try it!

I've deployed it on firebase, you can check the link below :)

👉 [`https://chatroom-10387.web.app`](https://chatroom-10387.web.app)

Below is an example of using it. You can preview the webpage by jumping to [`https://chatroom-10387.web.app/home`](https://chatroom-10387.web.app/home) page since I implemented the web app with React Router v6.

> Of course, directly jump without authentication will limit function you may do. 🫠

> Also notice that the date time display is based on your locale.

You can also route to other pages such as `/404`, `/sign`, `/signin`, `/signup`. See `src/util/router` for more details.

## Frameworks

> See `package.json` for more details.
